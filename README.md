Experiments with Jetty Server and JaxRS
========================================

The purpose of this project is:
1. To learn the structure of Servlets
2. To learn what "deploying a jetty app" actually means. (Hint: its just copying over a WAR file into the webapps/ directory)
3. To learn how to package a WAR file.
4. To learn the ins and outs of the all-important web.xml file



Notes:
1. Since this project is small, I won't .gitignore the compiled .class files or dependency jars.
2. Start jetty: `./bin/jetty.sh start`
